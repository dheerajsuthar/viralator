Changes from 0.9.5
- Fixed bug regarding URL with spaces
- Removed hardcoded HTML (using CGI.pm functions to
generate them)
- Included encoding and language into the HTML header (created a single
function to deal with HTML header generation)
- create constant for all regular expressions used with clean_taint
- Made the CSS external of Viralator code (references it thru HTML code)
- Added new parameter for download subdirectory permissions (UMASK)


Changes from 0.9.4
- Fixed bug with IPC::Open3 (the parent process sometimes finished before child process)
- Include two new configuration parameters: charset and scannersummary
- Fixed bug regarding REGEX matching valid when requested a file for download
- Remove deprecated "antivirus" parameter from viralator.conf
- Thanks to perltidy program, now Viralator code looks much nicer than before :-)
- Improved error messages
- Code cleanup (removed duplicated Javascript code)
- Changed function name "load_css" to "set_style"

Changes from 0.9.3
- Fixed bug with IPC::Open3 (not checking error properly);
- Fixed bug related to concurrent download (temporary directories implemented)
- Fixed bug from progress bar related to Internet Explorer
- Fixed bug related to Clamav parameters (must use --stdout option)
- Implemented popup windows size control from viralator.conf
- Popup window now uses the same name from the downloading file
- New progress bar (uses image files, configuration from viralator.conf)


Changes from 0.9.2.5

- deleteaction was removed from viralator.conf; for privacy reasons, the downloaded files will not be maintained anymore;
- The calls for "test_filename" (a replaced function) were corrected to the newer one;
- Missing referer information will be treated in a different manner: Viralator will print an Javascript function (history.go(-1)) so the user can still go back to previous page;
- Viralator will not redirect users to previous page automatically: the user will be able to choose between going to the previous page (from referer information or from an Javascript button) or going to the main page of the server (only avaible if the referer information was given);
- Wget is not used anymore: LWP will be used instead. This give access to more information and control to the download process and avoid system calls;
- Better progress bar and overall design of the pages (CSS use is included);
- Viralator now kills the download request correctly when the "stop" button is pressed by the user;
- Viruscanner is now being called with IPC::Open3 function, which avoid Viralator to uses the shell to run the program, being more secure so;
- The popup issue was solved by including a button in the form, so the user can start the download by clicking on it. This avoid software that block popup windows to stop Viralator download window to be opened;


Changes from 0.9.2.4

- A Perl script to test translation files is shipped together with messages (test_lang.pl);
- Better wget messages treatment;
- Taint mode was turned on again, so values from viralator.conf are checked now as well
- logfile option in viralator.conf was removed (since not being used anymore);
- deleteaction (parameter in viralator.conf) behaviour was changed;
- added a Javascript function to make the button being visible without using the lift bar (thanks to Guillaume Girard (cyberoux@wanadoo.fr) for the advice);
- removed hardcode message and moved to translation file (see english.txt to see the diff) Brazilian Portuguese messages updated;

Changes from 0.9.2.3

- Corrected minor bug when reading configuration file;
- Corrected minor bug regarding the repository testing (in viruscmd directive spaces are not being preserved when having more than one parameter);
- Brazilian Portuguese messages updated;

Changes from 0.9.2.2

- Clamav antivirus now is tested and working with Viralator
- Functions to check the parameters passed through the request url.
- Rewrote code to check taint values in parameters.
- Bugs corrected from previous version;
- All information about errors are logged in errors.log from Apache, instead creating a separated file.
- CGI protection againts DOS atacks regarding large requests included;
- All values are being created from CGI parameters (fetched from CGI.pm)
- User presentation improved;
- All generated pages includes HTTP parameter 'NOCACHE' for proxies not cache the pages generated by
Viralator;
- Error treatment improved (separated as WARNING and ERROR);
- Lots of code rewritten and cleaned up;

- Some code rewrite, including the use of the pragma "strict" and "warning";
- Brazilian Portuguese support added;

better error messages to users;
