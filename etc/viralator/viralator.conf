#VIRALATOR CONFIGURATION FILE
# The configuration uses this syntax:
# directive -> value
# Pay attention that the separator must be always an arrow

# DEFAULT LANGUAGE
# The default language that will be used in Viralator forms
default_language -> english.txt

# DEFAUL CHARACTER SET
# Viralator will use by default the charset ISO-8859-1 in the HTTP
# header unless you define something different in the parameter below.
# Please keep in mind that, even that this parameter is not obligatory,
# you should put a value to it if your default_language file uses a
# different character set than ISO-8859-1
charset -> ISO-8859-1

#DEFAULT LANGUAGE
# This value is used to set a value for the HTML header
# See http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt for details about the value
# that you should use here
lang -> en-US

# SERVER NAME
# You can put a default value to viralator.cgi use as servername when
# creating HTML forms. You should use it only you have some weird configuration,
# since viralator.cgi is capable to get the servername from HTTP variables.

# VIRUS SCANNER
# The actually virus scanner program
# Some examples below:
# INOCULATE => inocucmd
# AVP       => AvpLinux
# RAV       => ravlin8
# ANTIVIR   => antivir
# MCAFEE    => uvscan
# SOPHOS    => sweep
# TREND     => vscan
# CLAMAV    => clamscan
# BITDEFENDER console free edition: bdc
# DON'T use spaces, "-", "_" or any other non alphabetic character
# WARNING: the viruscanner must use STDOUT for normal output and STDERR
# for error messages, or Viralator will not work properly
virusscanner -> clamdscan

# VIRUS SCANNER PATHNAME
# Added this to make life easier when untainting code
# The path info to get to the antivirus executable
# Here below are some regular samples for each antivirus Viralator can deal with:
# INOCULATE => /usr/local/av
# AVP       => /usr/local/AvpLinux
# RAV       => /usr/bin 		  
# ANTIVIR   => /usr/local/AntiVir
# MCAFEE    => /usr/local/uvscan      
# SOPHOS    => /usr/local/bin   	  
# TREND     => /usr/local/trend   
# CLAMAV    => /usr/local/bin
# BITDEFENDER console free edition: /usr/bin
scannerpath -> /usr/bin

# COMMAND OPTIONS
# Antivirus scanner commands samples
#
# INOCULATE => -FST -VER 
# AVP just doesn´t have any options
# RAV       => -UNZIP
# ANTIVIR   => -z	   		          
# MCAFEE    => --summary --noexpire --unzip 
# SOPHOS    => -archive -di -remove -nc
# TREND     => -za -d
# BITDEFENDER console free edition: --all --arc --log=/etc/viralator/logs/bdc.log
#viruscmd -> --verbose --stdout -l /tmp/test.log --log-verbose
viruscmd -> --verbose --stdout

# VIRUS FOUNDED ALERT MESSAGE
# This should change for an antivirus program to another.
# One should try the antivirus scanner of your choice running in the shell, and
# see the message that indicates that a virus was found.
# Below are some examples: if they don't work, you should try the scanner 
#by hand, with a test like EICAR virus, which is inoffensive, but is accused as
#a virus by any antivirus scanner.
# INOCULATE => Total Viruses Found
# AVP       => Known viruses :
# RAV       => Infected:
# ANTIVIR   => Infected:
# MCAFEE    => Infected: .....
# SOPHOS    => Infected:
# TREND     => Infected:
# CLAMAV => FOUND
# BITDEFENDER console free edition: infected:
alert -> FOUND

# VIRUS SCANNER SUMMARY
# The variable below will give information to Viralator
# when it should show the viruscanner information or not.
# Valid values are true and false.
scannersummary -> true

# DOWNLOAD PATHNAME
# Complete path to downloaded files
downloads -> /srv/www/default/html/downloads

# SKIP DOWNLOADS
# This parameter make possible for Viralator to avoid printing
# any virus scanner output that contains the directory defined
# in the "downloads" parameter. This is useful if you want to
# hide this directory in the webserver from curious users.
# Valid values are "true" and "false"
skip_downloads -> true

# WEB PATH
# Web path to downloaded files
downloadsdir -> /downloads          

# POPUP FAST
# show the download popup window immediately when a download starts
popupfast -> false

# POPUP BACK
# parent browser window goes back to last page when the download window is shown
popupback -> false

# POPUP WIDTH
# width of the download popup window
popupwidth -> 600

# POPUP HEIGHT
# height of the download popup window
popupheight -> 400

# FILECHMOD
# default permissions of the downloaded file (octal notation)
filechmod -> 0644

# DIRMASK
# default UMASK for the directories created by Viralator to hold the downloaded files (octal notation)
dirmask -> 0022

# DELETE ACTION
# the delete action parameter is no longer avaiable,
# since we believe that user privacy may be deny because
# of it. All files will be delete by default after user download

# Password phrase
# this parameter will be used to protect the parameters passed through
# hidden fields in the forms created by Viralator. It's HIGHLY recommended
# that the system administrator changes the value below to something
# equally hard to guess

# Progress bar
# The parameters below are used for the graphics files

# DON'T forget to copy the images to the location you choosed!
