Viralator - Installation


There are specific instructions for Slackware here written by David Wilson (dave at linuxbox.co.za).

How it Works
Pick up the url of the file the user wants to download
Download the file into its own directory on the server - useing wget
Show status of download in pop up window.
Run virus scanner against this file and have virus scanner clean or delete any infected files
Check to see if the file still exists after scan
If no virus found start automated download like Tucows website does
If virus is found display an "virus found" message
Have close window button on popup windows that deletes the downloaded file
Collecting the software you need
Squid proxy server www.squid-cache.org (you probably already have this)
Apache Web Server (you probably have this program)
Apache-suexec (some packaged versions of Apache come with this, Mandrake Linux does not) See the FAQ, you may not need this
Squirm Redirector 1.23 for Squid www.senet.com.au/squirm/ (rpm available) or SquidGuard
A antivirus scanner - a complete list can be found at the About section
Setup steps
I am assuming that you have already got Apache, Squid and (maybe) Apache-suexec installed, please refer to the install guide that comes with each of those programs.
Use a redirector: we have used Squirm and received some positive reports about using SquidGuards as well.
Squirm
Install Squirm 1.23. If you installed squid 1.23 from rpm it expects to find sqirm.paterns in /usr/etc - I dont know why! Just copy it there or symlink it from /etc/squid/.
Add the following lines to your squirm.paterns file change [your proxy ip] to the ip or address of the proxy server.
        abortregexi (^http://[your proxy ip].*) #eg  (^http://192\.168\.100\.1/.*)
	abortregexi (^http://[your proxy fully qualified domain name].*)
        regexi (^.*\.zip$) http://[yourproxyip]/cgi-bin/viralator.cgi?url=|\1
        regexi (^.*\.doc$) http://[yourproxyip]/cgi-bin/viralator.cgi?url=|\1
        regexi (^.*\.exe$) http://[yourproxyip]/cgi-bin/viralator.cgi?url=|\1
keep adding lines for each type of file you wish to scan.
Ps: If you installed Squirm 1.0 remove the ^ from each line.
Ps2: For Viralator beta versions (0.9pre2.4 and later) just remove the pipe symbol from each line, like this:
regexi (^.*\.zip$) http://[yourproxyip]/cgi-bin/viralator.cgi?url=\1
Without this modification, the BETA version of Viralator will not work.
SquidGuard

squidGuard.conf --> /etc/squid/squidGuard.conf

Logdir /var/log
Dbhome /etc/squid/squidGuard/db

#### Group of domains & urls with access permit
dest permitidos {					
	domainlist	permitidos/domais		  
	urllist	permitidos/urls		 
}							

#### "permitidos" is the name of control list
#### "domains" a file in the subforder permitidos under folder db
(/etc/squid/squidGuard/db)
#### "urls" a file in the  subforder permitidos under folder db
(/etc/squid/squidGuard/db)

#### Group of domains & urls with access forbidden
dest proibidos {
	domainlist	proibidos/domains 
	urllist	proibidos/urls
}

#### "proibidos" is the name of control list
#### "domains" a file in the subforder proibidos under folder db
(/etc/squid/squidGuard/db)
#### "urls" a file in the  subforder proibidos under folder db
(/etc/squid/squidGuard/db)

#### Group of file types to be scanned or forbidden to download
dest file {
	expressionlist proibidos/files
}

#### "file" is the name of control list
#### "files" a file in the  subforder proibidos under folder db
(/etc/squid/squidGuard/db

#### Group of users to apply the polices
src users {
	userlist	proibidos/usuarios
}

#### "users" is the name of control list
#### "user" a file in the  subforder proibidos under folder db
(/etc/squid/squidGuard/db

#### Apply rules based in the created control list above
acl {
	users {
		pass permitidos !proibidos !files all 
		redirect http://mywebserver/forbidden.html
	}
	default {
		pass !files all
		redirect
http://mywebserver/cgi-bin/viralator.cgi?url=%u
}
If the user is in the "users" control list the rule are: pass domains and urls in the "permitidos" control list; blocked the acces to sites and domains in the "proibidos" control list; pass only download files NOT matched in the "file" control list.
For all other users pass all and redirect the download file types to the viralator.cgi .
The files: /etc/squid/squidGuard/db/proibidos/domains

/etc/squid/squidGuard/db/proibidos/files:
(\.exe$|\.com$|\.bat$|\.zip$)
Make sure that Apache knows about each mime type of the files you want to scan or all you will get is a screen full of binary.
Edit squid.conf adding Squirm or any other redirector by adding these lines:
redirect_program /usr/squid/bin/"redirector binary name"
redirect_children 10
You can put a higher number at "redirection_children" with you have many users. You should test this parameter.

Of course, don't put the double quote in the squid.conf file. Just put the binary filename of the redirector you're using.

Create a user and group for suexec to use. I called mine viralator. You can ignore this if you are not using suexec.
Add the user and group information to your apache vhosts.conf or httpd.conf file. This enables suexec. Here is an example from my vhosts.conf file
        VirtualHost 192.168.100.1
        ServerAdmin webmaster@loddington.com
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html
        ServerName proxy.loddington.com
        ErrorLog logs/error_log
        TransferLog logs/access_log
        ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /var/www/cgi-bin/
        User viralator
        Group viralator
        /VirtualHost
Create a directory in a web viewable area (inside htdocs or html directory) called downloads and set permissions to 755
Copy this script to your cgi-bin
Change the ownership and group of your cgi-bin to viralator (chown viralator.viralator -R cgi-bin) You can ignore this if you are not using suexec
Make sure that you have correct file permissions for this script. I used chmod 755 viralator.cgi
Edit the viralator script to make sure you have the correct settings for the location of your virus scanner, wget, web root and download directory. It is all together under housekeeping on line 27.
Restart Squid and Apache so your changes can take effect.
Since version 0.8 we no longer need to set the users browser to exclude the proxy IP address from being cached as we use the abortregexi command in squirm.patterns
Try to download a zip file, if it does not work look in the Apache error logs or the redirector error logs
Try to download this test zip file. It contains the eicar test virus signature. It is not a real virus and is harmless but it will set off most virus scanners.
Look in the FAQ for solutions to some common problems and information on how to make wget use the proxy so downloads are cached
