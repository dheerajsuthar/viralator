NOTE: 
This code is uploaded here solely to keep an archive of the original code. My fascination for it is due to its usage in the sci-fi movie One Point O (2004) where the protagonist uses it on many occasions 
(https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317042/trivia?item=tr0764685). I want the legacy to live on for future wanderers :)

All credits go to original developers.
